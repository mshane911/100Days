				Heyyy! We made it to 100 days! I love you so much Shannen, thank you for
				being with me always for the past 100 Days, it was the best 100 days of
				my life. I can never imagine my life without you from now on, so don't
				you ever think of leaving me, and I know I won't, you are my partner, my
				love, my life, my home, my everything, nothing in this world, not a
				single thing can change how I felt about you, yes I may be hurt now and
				then, but even when I'm hurt, I still love you and care about you. I'm
				sorry if I ever hurt you, I love you, I don't want to hurt you, I'm
				sorry. I promise I'll love you and be with you for the rest of my life,
				100 days felt like a minute with you, and I want to spend the rest of my
				life to be with you. I love you so much Shan, I know this isn't much, I
				hope you loved it. Love you my love.
